The following are the variables generated by the "run_analysis.R" file as they appear in the script

act_labels. contains the indexes and names of the activity labels

features. contains all the parameters measured including their transformation

For the train data set:

subject_train. subject number for each observation n=7352

x_train. values for each subject and feature 

y_train. type of activity for each observation 

For the test data set:

subject_test. subject number for each observation n=7352

x_test. values for each subject and feature 

y_test. type of activity for each observation 

For the transformations in step 2

extrValuesmean. contains the indexes of the variables that contain meand or std in their names

mean_final_set. it is the subsetted data set

For the transformation in step 5

summary_data. is the mean of the variables by subject and activity
